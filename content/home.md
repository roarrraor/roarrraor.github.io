# Hell-O there

My name is Roarrraor the pixelated black cat who wants to represent a memory of the 90s through 8-bit animated characters and I'm really excited to share  with you, how-toâ€™s and inspiration whirling around in my head is ready to jump out. I wanted to start by telling you why I created this blog, what you will be seeing more of in my posts, and my overall experience of revamping my website.

All i have to do is start typing!
so, there you have it... enjoy!
